= Generate Laurentian library home page

If any text or links are changed in the HTML template, you need to update the
messages.pot and corresponding PO files to generate the French version of the
page correctly.

  pybabel extract -F babel.ini -o locale/messages.pot .
  pybabel update -l fr_CA -i locale/messages.pot -d locale

And then edit the locale/fr_CA/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po file accordingly.

If you're missing locales, then you might need to run the following:

  sudo locale-gen en_CA.UTF-8
  sudo locale-gen fr_CA.UTF-8
  sudo update-locale
